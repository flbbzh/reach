## The Data Model

The data model is described as a JSON schema on github in the [webcom-components/reach-schema](https://github.com/webcom-components/reach-schema) repo.
 
See [](https://webcom-components.github.io/reach-schema/#draft-00) to visualize the data model used in Reach.

The corresponding Security Rules can be found here [](https://webcom-components.github.io/reach-schema/draft-00/security/rules.json).

You will need to import those rules in order to enforce security in your application. Take a look at the test results to understand these rules.
